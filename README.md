# glibc-legal-notice

This package is a stub package whose license metadata describes the dependency on the GNU C Library. If you use something like [legal-eagle](https://github.com/atom/legal-eagle) to generate a LICENSES file for your project, you can include this module to generate the appropriate notice for linking to glibc.
